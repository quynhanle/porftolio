        <h4 class="section-title" >CHALLENGE</h4>
        <p class="section-text" class="normal">When it comes to problem-solving, Shell IT often creates solutions that focus solely on technology and business needs. Most of these solutions fail to yield expected business outcomes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h4 class="section-title">SOLUTION</h4>
        <p class="section-text">We created Shell bespoke up-skilling program - Spark, human-centred design for Business. Our goal is to up-skill 4,000 Shell IT staff with the skills and mindset of human-centred approach to problem-solving. </p>

        <h4 class="section-title">OUTCOME</h4>
        <p class="section-text">We piloted the first experiment - Spark Taster workshop to 20 early adopters. Their insightful feedback helped validate our key hypotheses and helped us make informed strategic decisions for the overall Spark program.</p>

        <p>"How might we bring a human-centred approach to problem-solving in Shell?" <br><br> To truly understand the challenge, we held semi-structured interviews with four business leaders across HR and IT. Our main question was: "Why does Shell care about human-centred design?". We learnt that Shell leaders see growing human-centred design as imperative to the company's survival long term. As a result, we positioned Spark under Shell’s winning capability. </p>

        <p>To achieve a global scale we needed to create a self-sustaining program. We designed a four-module learning program that defined Spark roadmap. The outcome we hope to achieve upon completing the program, 20% of trained IT professionals would become Human-centred Design Practitioners who will be able to take others on the same journey of learning. </p>

<!--User Research-->

<div class="text">
    <div class="phase">
      <h3 class="phase-title">User research</h3>
      <p>To remove our own biases, I've picked a diverse group of eight Shell members for 1:1 contextual interview. I aimed to understand their deep aspirations for Spark. The discussion guide was centred around one question: "How does your ideal learning experience look like?". Interview synthesis boiled down to Spark participants’ two primary needs:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Visible leadership support</li>
        <li>Practical skills to apply in their job</li>
    </div>
</div>


<!--Branding p1-->

<div class="text">
    <div class="phase">
        <h3 class="phase-title">Branding</h3>
        <p>"How might we create visible leadership support for Spark participants?" 
            Visibility stems from recognition, recognition - from identity. We decided to tackle the challenge from the perspective of a brand. Spark brand needed to be both corporate yet personal; serious yet warm; fresh yet recognisable. We crafted the logo, colour, and tone of voice to reflect Spark personality.  </p>

        <p>Our next challenge: "How might we create the learning experience that equips members with practical human-centred design skills?".
            Running the ideation workshop with designers and Shell members, we came up with three very different directions for the program experience and 100+ ideas to deliver it. We synthesised workshop outcomes into the To Be Journey map and prioritised the list of ideas into the backlog  to form MVP.  </p>

<!--Hypothesis-->

<div class="text">
    <div class="phase">
        <h3 class="phase-title">Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>To test the product-market fit, we decided to run one-day Taster Workshop - a high-level overview for participants to get a taste  of the Spark program.

            Our key hypothesis was: "Spark offers participants practical human-centred design skills to apply in their day jobs." We know we are right if at least 60% of people felt workshop learnings are "applicable" to their day-to-day. </p>
    </div>
</div>

<!--Design-->

<div class="text">
    <div class="phase">
        <h3 class="phase-title">Design</h3>
        <p>We crafted every learning material with the Shell context in mind. Shell bespoke loop aims at guiding teams through human-centred approach to problem-solving. To give members tangible takeaways, I have written and designed Spark Cards to prompt participants to apply Human-centred Design methods in their daily challenges.</p>

<!--Outcome-->

<div class="text">
    <div class="phase">
        <h3 class="phase-title">Outcome</h3>
        <p>Key business outcomes of this experiments are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><spain>Product-market fit:</spain> 80% of members scored their learnings as "applicable" on the workshop survey. Our key hypothesis proved to be correct: "Spark offers practical skills for participants to apply in their job."</li>
            <li><span>The program offers: </span> Some participants have different needs when it comes to learning human-centred design. We included additional services in the program offerring to cater to different participants’ needs.</li>
            <li><span>Barriers to entry: </span>most participants find it hard to commit the whole day for learning.  Hence we decided to run our future sessions in shorter modules to help participants fit the learning in their busy schedules.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

<!--My learning-->

<div class="text">
    <div class="phase">
        <h3 class="phase-title">My key learning</h3>
        <p>I realised how important it is to invest enough time in strategic thinking before running deep into the project delivery. Only with a clear purpose and intent would you and your team have confidence in executing the tactics.</p>
